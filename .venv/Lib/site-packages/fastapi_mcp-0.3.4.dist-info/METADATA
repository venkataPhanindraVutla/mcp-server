## Features

- **Authentication** built in, using your existing FastAPI dependencies!

- **FastAPI-native:** Not just another OpenAPI -> MCP converter

- **Zero/Minimal configuration** required - just point it at your FastAPI app and it works

- **Preserving schemas** of your request models and response models

- **Preserve documentation** of all your endpoints, just as it is in Swagger

- **Flexible deployment** - Mount your MCP server to the same app, or deploy separately

- **ASGI transport** - Uses FastAPI's ASGI interface directly for efficient communication


## Installation

We recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), a fast Python package installer:

```bash
uv add fastapi-mcp
```

Alternatively, you can install with pip:

```bash
pip install fastapi-mcp
```

## Basic Usage

The simplest way to use FastAPI-MCP is to add an MCP server directly to your FastAPI application:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi_mcp import FastApiMCP

app = FastAPI()

mcp = FastApiMCP(app)

# Mount the MCP server directly to your FastAPI app
mcp.mount()
```

That's it! Your auto-generated MCP server is now available at `https://app.base.url/mcp`.

## Documentation, Examples and Advanced Usage

FastAPI-MCP provides [comprehensive documentation](https://fastapi-mcp.tadata.com/). Additionaly, check out the [examples directory](examples) for code samples demonstrating these features in action.

## FastAPI-first Approach

FastAPI-MCP is designed as a native extension of FastAPI, not just a converter that generates MCP tools from your API. This approach offers several key advantages:

- **Native dependencies**: Secure your MCP endpoints using familiar FastAPI `Depends()` for authentication and authorization

- **ASGI transport**: Communicates directly with your FastAPI app using its ASGI interface, eliminating the need for HTTP calls from the MCP to your API

- **Unified infrastructure**: Your FastAPI app doesn't need to run separately from the MCP server (though [separate deployment](https://fastapi-mcp.tadata.com/advanced/deploy#deploying-separately-from-original-fastapi-app) is also supported)

This design philosophy ensures minimum friction when adding MCP capabilities to your existing FastAPI services.
